# Coursera-Machine-Learning
An intutive and feet-first introduction to fundamental machine learning algorithms. 

Algorithms were coded in Matlab/Octave.

The following models were studied:
#### Supervised Learning
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Networks
* Support Vector Machines

#### Unsupervised Learning
* K-Mean Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis

#### Other topics:
* Cost Functions and Hypothesis
* Gradient Descent and Normal Equations
* Feature Normalization
* Creating Features
* Bias-Variance Tradeoff
* Multiclass Classification
* Regularization
* Backpropogation
* Algorithm Evaluation and Opmization
* Error Analysis
* Large Margin Classification
